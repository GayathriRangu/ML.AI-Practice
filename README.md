# ML.AI-Practice
This rep contains all my practice codes, material, and notebooks, from Python basics, libraries to ML algorithms, Ensemble Learning to Neural Networks and Deep Learning concepts.
-----------------------
20/08/23-- Added Python basics implementation
  -> Contains the basic Python data structure practice
  -> Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples, Hashmaps, etc are covered         here

19/11/23-- Added 2. Implementing simple classifiers:
  -> This notebook has implementations of simple classifiers in Python. I have written code and notes from scratch to understand the details. PS: haven't used Scikit-learn here! 
  -> Perceptron model, Adaptive Linear Neuron, Optimized implementation of GD, Stochastic GD, Mini-batch GD using vectorized operations is implemented!
  -> Models are trained using a subset of the Iris dataset, using only sepal and petal lengths as the features.
